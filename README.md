### File Descriptions (chronological order):
#### contagion
### - Sentiment Polya Process Model: First Sem - Focuses on defining the Polya process and simulating contagion in the Metro Bank (3-node) network. 
###      ------Contains predictive analysis functions & data importing (outside the scope of Polya contagion/curing).
#### curing the contagion init
### - Polya_TD_Curing: Second Sem - Uses the TD contagion simulation from first semester to test curing strategies on a more complex network.
### - Final Curing GAH: Second Sem - This is a test/init file for our final solution. Strictly focuses on developing a working GAH (Greedy Adaptive Heuristic) curing strategy for the Hindenburg network.
### - Final Curing: Second Sem (Thesis) - Final application of our entire technical background onto Adani-Hindenburg. Three different curing strategies, compares them, optimizes best performing (GAH).
